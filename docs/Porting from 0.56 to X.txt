List of compatibility-breaking changes through Sphere versions.

Changed starting from 0.56b
------------------------
- [sphere_spells.scp]: mostly new spell flags.
- [sphere_skills.scp]: mostly new skill flags.
- [sphere_defs.scp]: lots of new defs, most importantly new mounts defs.
    (Mounts are now handled there, if they are not specified in the file they cannot be ridden).
- Update multis definitions from [itemdef 04xxx] to [multidef 0x].
- Changed MAPPLANE->MAP, LOCALLIGHT->LIGHT.
- Added MAPx to ini, IMPORTANT: add these values or current map (mapplanes in older versions) won't work, one MAP line per MAPPLANE. Add them or items in mapplanes and npcs will go to map0, not good idea to forget them:)
- Added: Encryption keys for clients are now in SphereCrypt.ini

Changed starting from 0.56c
-----------------------
- The MOUNT keyword now needs to be called on the rider and required as argument the UID of the npc to be ridden.
- Added: new .ADD dialog to replace old add menu. (old menu still available in the scripts by removing d_add dialog, but it is full of errors).
- memory_war_targ is no longer used for npc combats (in the source) but is still present for scripting backwards compat. Sphere now uses the 'Attacker' system.
- Spellbooks now store spell offset / max spells using TDATA3/TDATA4 instead MOREZ/MOREX.
- [sphere_spells.scp] Added LAYER=layer_spell_* to all magery, necromancy, spellweaving, chivalry and mysticism spells;
  ie LAYER=layer_spell_stats for s_bless,s_cunning, etc. Mysticism Enchant spell: Layer_spell_enchant.
- [sphere_defs.scp] Removed 'brain_beggar', 'brain_thief', 'brain_undead' and 'brain_vendor_offduty'.

Changed starting from 0.56d, before the creation of the new X branch
-----------------------
- Removed TAG.OVERRIDE.MAXWEIGHT and added ModMaxWeight.
- [sphere_speech.scp]: Moved hardcoded speech commands 'I must consider my sins', 'I resign from my guild' and 'I resign from my town' to scripts.

Compatibility changes from 0.56d to X1
-----------------------
- Change the whole sphere.ini file and tweak its settings (updating it doesn't usually work, people misses a lot of settings and flags).
- Renamed CLIENTISSA command to CLIENTISENHANCED.
- Removed CHARGESCUR and CHARGESMAX.
- TAG.SlayerGroup isn't used anymore. Use FACTION.
- ADDCLILOC needs to be called on the object, instead of on the player. So in the scripts, in the @ClientTooltip trigger,
  calls to SRC.ADDCLILOC have to be changed to ADDCLILOC; in @ItemClientTooltip and @CharClientTooltip, ACT.ADDCLILOC has to be used instead.
- Changed: Defname numeric value has a different byte order now. For example, <hval s_clumsy> returned 0ce000001,
  so you could retrieve the spell number by doing <hval s_clumsy&(~0ce000000)>, which removed the resource type bits.
  Now <hval s_clumsy> returns 082700001, so you can't use the previous code anymore. Use RESOURCEINDEX instead.
- CAN property is no more RW, but now it's read-only. Use CANMASK to change it on a per-char basis.
- Changed how combat skills work: now @SkillStart is called only once, when starting the fight, then the other triggers (@HitTry, @Hit*, @GetHit, etc)
  are called. Before, @SkillStart was called before each @HitTry call, so at every hit attempt. If you need a trigger firing before @HitTry, try @HitCheck.
- Added Focus skill functionality. Add to its flags SKF_DISABLED if you aren't interested.
- SPEECHCOLOR can't be used anymore to override the speech color of NPCS. Use SPEECHCOLOROVERRIDE instead.
- Added: ModMaxHits, ModMaxMana, ModMaxStam properties. To avoid CONFLICTS, remove or comment the scripted functions
  with the same name in the sphere_events_npcs.scp of the default scriptpack.
- DEF keyword doesn't find the numeric identifier of Resource (ITEMDEF/CHARDEF...) DEFNAMEs anymore. Use RESDEF. DEF is used to retrieve values from [DEFNAME] blocks.
  This can break compatibility with previous scripts, if you used DEF to retrieve items/chars defname numeric value. You have to use RESDEF now.
  You're safe (even if the underlying code is a bit slower) if you just used ID=i_dagger instead of ID=<DEF.i_dagger>.
- Added/changed some keywords for spawns (read the changelog for more). This causes a SAVE FILES INCOMPATIBILITY between x and 56d, because new x-only
  keywords will be saved, and those won't be recognized by 56d. If you want to port back the saves, you have to replace in sphereworld.scp the
  keyword SPAWNID with MORE1 in t_spawn_char and t_spawn_item items.
- Changed: RANGEL returns the lowest range value, while RANGEH returns the highest range value (as it should have been, but it looks like it got changed in 56c or 56d).
- @(Item)DropOn_Ground now fires BEFORE the new P is set! The new P is stored in the ARGS of the trigger. Prior to this change,
  the triggers were called after the new P was set.
- Now t_multi objects will be saved too in spheremultis.scp, along with t_multi_custom. This causes a SAVE FILES INCOMPATIBILITY between x and 56d.
  If you want to port back the saves, you'll need to manually move saved multis from spheremultis.scp to sphereworld.scp.
- Reworked and added MULTIDEF properties.
- Some decoration multis must have t_multi_addon instead of t_multi.
- [sphere_defs_types_hardcoded.scp] Added: t_multi_addon=201.
- [sphere_msgs.scp] Added: PROVOCATION_KIND.
- [sphere_def.scp] Added: DEFNAMEs house_types, DEFNAMEs house_transfer_types, CAN_I_BLOCKLOS_HEIGHT.
- price=xxx will not work anymore to fix a price on an item. Price will be use only when a player vendor sell an item. If an item have a price value, no NPC will buy it at this price.
  Value is READ only, if you want change the value of an item, you should use the new tag.override.value. When selling your item to NPC, it will look this value first.
  In your scripts, on your vendor template BUY= or SELL= if you want to set a different value of the itemdef you must use tag.override.value=xxx instead of old syntax price=xxx.

Suggestions
------------------------
- Move the char height value from the DEFs height_0x or height_ to the CharDef! It's way faster to access that property from the chardef, and Sphere checks it VERY often!
