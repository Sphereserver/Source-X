06-10-04, Vjaka
- Removed DISGUISE(NAME/VERSION), renamed the current version to 0.56a.

07-10-04, Vjaka
- Removed AGREE config line neccessaty since it is not longer R* series.
- Added startup expansion set support output depending on map*,statics*,staidx*
  files found and loaded (T2A, LBR, AOS, SE).
- Removed EF_New_Maps since it is integrated to source now, packet is sent when
  needed.
- Moving on other map now moves the same map on the server. But this currently
  does not use caching and re-read tile information from map files every time.
  Caching of same sectors but in different mapplanes will be in the future.
  You should both add regions for these maps, and place corresponding files in
  place where all other mul files resides.
- Changed values of EXPERIMENTAL flags to remove empty slots between items.

08-10-04, Vjaka
- Fixed memory leak caused by map cache removal.
- Fixed client screen update on map change.

08-10-04, Furio
- Added PROMPTCONSOLE, it makes the client prompt (like on page request) and send
  the response as an argument of a user definied function.
  (syntax PROMPTCONSOLE callback function, message to prompt)

10-10-04, Furio
- Added RESDISP properties to account. Accepted values are 0 (PreT2a client),
  1 (T2A), 2 (LBR), 3 (AoS), 4 (Samurai Empire). This is used to identify what type
  of client is logged in. As default is set at 0, but if the client is T2A is
  automatically set to 1 by Sphere. LBR, AoS and SE is not setted automatically and
  is leaved to you.
- Added to CHARDEF properties RESLEVEL, RESDISPDNID, RESDISPDNHUE. The first state
  from what UO version the anim comes. The second what anim id is shown to older
  client version. The third an hue shown to older client (if 0 or null the default
  anim hue is used.
- Modified scriptpack to reflect these changes for T2A monsters.

22-10-04, Vjaka
- Added <dVALUE> as a shortcut to <eval <VALUE>> to get a decimal value of a
  single expr like a variable. Note, this affects EF_Intrinsic_Locals a bit.
- Commands with .command and spaces before will be treated as without spaces,
  since extra space makes privileged chars to reveal self.
- Added TAG.PARTY_CANLOOTME for party. If 1, allows party to loot self.
- Added @Kill trigger (SRC-killer, ARGO-killed)
- Added sector function ALLCHARS,ALLITEMS similar to ALLCLIENTS. For regions
  you can use SECTORS.ALLCHARS, SECTORS.ALLITEMS.
- Changed GODPORT to accept port number as well. Old values ( <=0 = disables,
  1=ServPort+1000) are still working also.
- Added SYSCMD and SYSSPAWN commands to run external applications. Returns <0 if
  there was an error. The first one blocks while program is running while the
  second spawns and continues scripts execution. Due to obvious security fear
  in these commands, they are disabled if OF_FileCommands is not set. Up to 9
  command line arguments are passed to the external application.

23-10-04, Furio

- Fixed a bug where some clients were crashing when adding an item.

28-10-04, Vjaka
- Disabled string 'q'/'Q' to be said by privileged accounts. It is due the
  fact that default macro for repeat is Ctrl+Q, and one less Ctrl press will
  lead to GM to reveal self existance around, which really is not good.
