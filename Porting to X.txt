List of compatibility-breaking changes through Sphere versions.

Changed starting from 0.56b
------------------------
- [sphere_spells.scp]: mostly new spell flags.
- [sphere_skills.scp]: mostly new skill flags.
- [sphere_defs.scp]: lots of new defs.
- Update multis definitions from [itemdef 04xxx] to [multidef 0x].

Changed starting from 0.56c
-----------------------
- The MOUNT keyword now needs to be called on the rider and required as argument the UID of the npc to be ridden.
- Added: new .ADD dialog to replace old add menu. (old menu still available in the scripts by removing d_add dialog, but it is full of errors).
- memory_war_targ is no longer used for npc combats (in the source) but is still present for scripting backwards compat. Sphere now uses the 'Attacker' system.
- Spellbooks now store spell offset / max spells using TDATA3/TDATA4 instead MOREZ/MOREX.
- [sphere_spells.scp] Added LAYER=layer_spell_* to all magery, necromancy, spellweaving, chivalry and mysticism spells;
  ie LAYER=layer_spell_stats for s_bless,s_cunning, etc. Mysticism Enchant spell: Layer_spell_enchant.
- [sphere_defs.scp] Removed 'brain_beggar', 'brain_thief', 'brain_undead' and 'brain_vendor_offduty'.

Changed starting from 0.56d, before the creation of the new X branch
-----------------------
- Removed TAG.OVERRIDE.MAXWEIGHT and added ModMaxWeight.
- [sphere_speech.scp]: Moved hardcoded speech commands 'I must consider my sins', 'I resign from my guild' and 'I resign from my town' to scripts.

Compatibility changes from 0.56d to X1
-----------------------
- Change the whole sphere.ini file and tweak its settings (updating it doesn't usually work, people misses a lot of settings and flags).
- Renamed CLIENTISSA command to CLIENTISENHANCED.
- Removed CHARGESCUR and CHARGESMAX.
- ADDCLILOC needs to be called on the object, instead of on the player. So in the scripts, in the @ClientTooltip trigger,
  calls to SRC.ADDCLILOC have to be changed to ADDCLILOC; in @ItemClientTooltip and @CharClientTooltip, ACT.ADDCLILOC has to be used instead.
- CAN property is no more RW, but now it's read-only. Use CANMASK to change it on a per-char basis.
- Added Focus skill functionality. Add to its flags SKF_DISABLED if you aren't interested.
- SPEECHCOLOR can't be used anymore to override the speech color of NPCS. Use SPEECHCOLOROVERRIDE instead.
- Added: ModMaxHits, ModMaxMana, ModMaxStam properties. To avoid CONFLICTS, remove or comment the scripted functions
  with the same name in the sphere_events_npcs.scp of the default scriptpack.
- Added/changed some keywords for spawns (read the changelog for more). This causes a SAVE FILES INCOMPATIBILITY between x and 56d, because new x-only
  keywords will be saved, and those won't be recognized by 56d. If you want to port back the saves, you have to replace in sphereworld.scp the
  keyword SPAWNID with MORE1 in t_spawn_char and t_spawn_item items.
- Changed: RANGEL returns the lowest range value, while RANGEH returns the highest range value (as it should have been, but it looks like it got changed in 56c or 56d).
- Now t_multi objects will be saved too in spheremultis.scp, along with t_multi_custom. This causes a SAVE FILES INCOMPATIBILITY between x and 56d.
  If you want to port back the saves, you'll need to manually move saved multis from spheremultis.scp to sphereworld.scp.
- Reworked and added MULTIDEF properties.
- Some decoration multis must have t_multi_addon instead of t_multi.
- [sphere_defs_types_hardcoded.scp] Added: t_multi_addon=201.
- [sphere_msgs.scp] Added: PROVOCATION_KIND.
- [sphere_def.scp] Added: DEFNAMEs house_types, DEFNAMEs house_transfer_types, CAN_I_BLOCKLOS_HEIGHT.

Suggestions
------------------------
- Move the char height value from the DEFs height_0x or height_ to the CharDef! It's way faster to access that property from the chardef, and Sphere checks it VERY often!
